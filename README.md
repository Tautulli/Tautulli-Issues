# Tautulli Issues

Welcome to the [Tautulli][] Issues repository!

## Installation and Support

*   The [Installation Guide][Installation] shows you how to install PlexPy.
*   The [FAQ][] in the wiki helps with most common problems.

There are many options available on the [support][] section of the Tautulli
website if the above doesn't help.

## Feature Requests

This is **not** the place to file a feature request! Please head over to [FeatHub][]
and search the existing issues. If a similar idea has already been posted,
give it a thumbs up (+1). If you can't find your idea then feel free to file a
new request _over there_, thanks!

## Bug Reports

If you think you've found a bug in Tautulli make sure you have read the [FAQ][]
first to make sure it hasn't been covered by one of the questions there. If your
problem isn't answered in the FAQ try the following first:

-   Update to the latest version of Tautulli.
-   Turning your device off and on again.
-   Analyzing your logs, you just might find the solution yourself!
-   Using the **search** function to see if this issue has already been reported/solved.
-   Checking the [Wiki][] for [Installation][] instructions and reading the [FAQs][FAQ].
-   For basic questions try asking on one of the [support][] options first before opening an issue.

##### If nothing has worked:

1.  Open a new issue on the GitHub [issue tracker][].
2.  Provide a clear title to easily help identify your problem.
3.  Use proper [Markdown syntax][] to structure your post (i.e. code/log in code blocks).
4.  Make sure to fill out the required information on the issue template.
5.  Close your issue when it's solved! If you found the solution yourself please
    comment so that others benefit from it.
